Add transactional events to your eloquent models. Will automatically detect changes in your models within a transaction 
and will fire events on commit or rollback. Should mimic the same functionality as 
[transactional callbacks](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html#transaction-callbacks) in Ruby on 
Rails.

You want to use this if you want to listen on events fired by models within a transaction and you want to be sure the transaction has completed successfully (or is rolled back).


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require mvanduijker/laravel-transactional-model-events
```

## Usage

Just add the trait TransactionalAwareEvents to your model or base model.

```php
<?php

class MyModel extends Model
{
    use TransactionalAwareEvents;
}
```

The following events will become available:

* `afterCommit.created`
* `afterCommit.saved`
* `afterCommit.updated`
* `afterCommit.deleted`
* `afterCommit.restored`
* `afterCommit.forceDeleted`
* `afterRollback.created`
* `afterRollback.saved`
* `afterRollback.updated`
* `afterRollback.deleted`
* `afterRollback.restored`
* `afterRollback.forceDeleted`

You can add listeners in you EventServiceProvider the same way as normal events

```php
<?php

/**
 * The event listener mappings for the application.
 *
 * @var array
 */
protected $listen = [
    'eloquent.afterCommit.created: App\Models\Shipment' => [
        'App\Listeners\SendShipmentNotification',
    ],
];

```

Or you can put them in your model boot method:

```php
<?php

class PictureFile extends Model
{
    use TransactionalAwareEvents;
    
    public static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();
        
        static::registerModelEvent('afterCommit.deleted', function ($model) {
            if (Storage::exists($model->file)) {
                Storage::delete($model->file);            
            }
        });
    }
}
```

You should also be able to map them to event classes

```php
<?php

class PictureFile extends Model
{
    use TransactionalAwareEvents;
    
    protected $dispatchesEvents = [
        'afterCommit.created' => PictureFileCreated::class,
        'afterCommit.deleted' => PictureFileDeleted::class,
    ];
}
```

And as icing on the cake, you can observe them with the following methods:

* `afterCommitCreated`
* `afterCommitSaved`
* `afterCommitUpdated`
* `afterCommitDeleted`
* `afterCommitRestored`
* `afterCommitForceDeleted`
* `afterRollbackCreated`
* `afterRollbackSaved`
* `afterRollbackUpdated`
* `afterRollbackDeleted`
* `afterRollbackRestored`
* `afterRollbackForceDeleted` 

For example:

```php
<?php

class PictureFileObserver
{
    public function afterCommitDeleted(PictureFile $model)
    {
        if (Storage::exists($model->file)) {
            Storage::delete($model->file);            
        }
    }
}
```

And register the observer in you ServiceProvider:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register()
    {
        //
    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        PictureFile::observe(PictureFileObserver::class);
    }
}
```

Since Laravel [version 10.44](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-10-44-0#content-new-observedby-attribute-for-models)
it's also possible to register the observer with the`ObservedBy` attribute.

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\ObservedBy; 

#[ObservedBy(PictureFileObserver::class)]
class PictureFileObserver
{
...
}
```

Multiple database connections are supported, events are triggered when the transaction is committed on the configured
connection of the model.
